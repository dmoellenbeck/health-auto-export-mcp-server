# Health Auto Export

This project provides examples of how to work with the TCP server in [Health Auto Export](https://apple.co/3iqbU2d) app for iPhone/iPad.

You can make queries to the server directly over TCP, or the project can be connected to LLMs, such as Claude app for desktop, via MCP.

In the `/docs` folder you will find more detailed instructions.

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd health-auto-export-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure `.env` file**:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
   - Set the appropriate value for `HAE_HOST` (your device IP address)

4. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### TCP

`client_example.ts` provides an example of a client that connects to the Health Auto Export server over TCP.

1. Build the project using `npm run build`
2. Run the client using `node ./dist/client_example.js`
3. Expand on the code to build your own integration

### Configure Claude MCP

Refer to `server.ts`

1. Build the project using `npm run build`
2. Navigate to `Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config`
3. This should open `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Add the MCP server details as shown below, pointing to the correct path on disk where you have set up this project:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "health_auto_export": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/username/Desktop/hae-mcp/dist/server.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Restart Claude Desktop
6. Keep in mind Claude's context window limitations when using MCP. This means data may need to be aggregated appropriately in order to process requests.
